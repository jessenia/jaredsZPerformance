# jaredsZPerformance website

Jared's Z Performance is an automotive repair shop.  I originally started this project with him as a way to help his small business expand its online presence in the Milledgeville, GA area. The goal was to first have a website with information about the different services his business offered. Then to integrate a booking system. However, Jared closed up shop and went to fulfill his dream of moving to Florida to live on a boat. The project remains in hiatus indefinitely.
